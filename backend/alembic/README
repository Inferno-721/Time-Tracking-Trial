Alembic Migrations
==================

This folder contains database migration scripts managed by Alembic.

Basic commands:

- Initialize migrations (already done):
    alembic init backend/alembic

- Create a new migration after model changes:
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Describe your change"

- Apply migrations to the database:
    alembic upgrade head

- Downgrade (rollback) the last migration:
    alembic downgrade -1

Alembic reads its configuration from alembic.ini in the backend directory.
